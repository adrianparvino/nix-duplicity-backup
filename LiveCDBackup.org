#+TITLE: Creation of a LiveCD for the restoration of a NixOS system backed up with nix-duplicity-backup

* Background
** NixOS LiveCD
   [[https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Creating_a_NixOS_live_CD][LiveCD Documentation]]

   NixOS has a mechanism that allows you to create a NixOS using
   something akin to configuration.nix on a permanent installation.

** Duplicity
   Duplicity allows near-realtime backups with compression and
   timestamping.

* Proposed solution
  We partition an external drive such that the bootable partition
  contains a NixOS bootable system and a duplicity backup
  partition. The system is a configuration that contains the
  restoration side of the nix-duplicity-backup script and the host
  system contains the backing up script to back up to the data
  partition rather than the current S3 backup backend.
