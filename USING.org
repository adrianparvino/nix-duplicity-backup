#+TITLE: nix-duplicity-backup
* Prerequisites and installation

  The canonical installation of nix-duplicity-backup is S3+Password.
  An alternative to S3 is rsync/SSH, however this is currently disabled.
  An alternative to Password login is the usage of GPG keys.
  Any S3 bucket will work provided that ACL permissions are granted to your user.

* Canonical Configuration

  As an example, nix-duplicity-backup, the repository will be backed up.
  An S3+Password configuration is used by default.
  First, create a ~duplicity-backup-config.nix~:
#+BEGIN_src nix
  # This serves as a configuration file, no backups will be created,
  # and this is a noop, sans assertions checking.
  {
    # This loads the common headers, the backup and restore script, yet disabled.
    imports = [ <nix-duplicity-backup/duplicity-backup.nix> ];

    services.duplicity-backup = {
      enable = true;

      # Use passphrase instead of GPG keys
      usePassphrase = true;

      # Add an archive to duplicity-backup
      archives.nix-duplicity-backup = {
        destination = s3://s3.REGION.amazonaws.com/BUCKETNAME/nix-duplicity-backup;

        # A list of files and directories to backup
        directories = [
          <nix-duplicity-backup>
        ];
      };
    };
  }
